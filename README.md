## About

#### Demo

An early prototype video demonstration can be seen here: https://youtu.be/oTZa19e4GS8


#### Features

As a solo developer working on this project in my free time for fun, progress is not always linear, but I am actively working on adding more games and features to the platform.

Currently, Reaktly only supports one game - Perfect Clicker. But rest assured, I am constantly working on improving the platform and adding new games to enhance the gaming experience.
